## Assignment #3: Program flow with turtles

### Regular polygons

Write a program that asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the border
color and the fill color of a regular polygon. 

The program should draw the polygon and then fill it in.

[regular.py](regular.py)

### 2. Polygons with turtles

Use *for* loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (all sides have the same length and
all inner angles have the same value):

- A square
- An equilateral triangle
- A hexagon (six sides)
- An octagon (eight sides)

### 3. For and range

Write a program that, for every even number n âˆˆ [20, 250], prints:

```
Python turtle number <n> is cool!
```

[range.py](range.py)

### 4. Turtle clock

Write a program that produces a turtle clock similar to the one shown below:

[clock.py](clock.py)

### 5. Stars

Consider a star-like shape, where each side consists of a straight line with a stamp at its end:
Write a program that draws this shape, with the number of sides provided by user input.
