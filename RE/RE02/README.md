## Assignment #2: Simple data

### 1. Variables and print

Create a file called [fox.py](fox.py) and write a program that takes the sentence: `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, stores each word of the sentence in a separate variable and then print the sentence using the variables you created.

### 2. Input and string operators

Create a file called [html.py](html.py) and write a program that asks a user to input a tag *h* and a string text and prints an HTML valid element of the form `<tag>text</tag>`.

For example, for a user input tag h1 and a text “I’m an HTML text”, the output must be `<h1>I’m an HTML text</h1>`.

### 3. Input and cast

Create a file called [cast.py](cast.py) and write a program that asks a user to input a number *n*, calculates the expression `n + nn + nnn` and prints its value.

For example, for a user input 5, the output must be 5 + 55 + 555 = 615.

### 4. Operations and operands

The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given on Wikipedia as:

```
A = P + (1 + r / n) ** (n + t)
```

Where:

- **P** - principal amount (the amount that the interest is provided on)
- **r** - the interest rate
- **n** - the frequency that the interest is paid out (per year)
- **t** - the number of years that the interest is calculated for

Create a file called [interests.py](interests.py) and write a program that replaces these letters with something a bit more human-readable, and calculate the final amount (A) at the end of the second year, for some varying amounts of money (P) at realistic interest rates (r).
